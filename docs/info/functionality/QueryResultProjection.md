## Query to Index Projection

**Abstract**

The purpose of this feature is to provide a consistent and general way to project a (general) query results into a
dedicated projection index

This index will be used to store the returning query-results assignments inside a single index, it will also be able to
efficiently perform slice & dice over the resulting assignments using
the efficient OpenSearch aggregation DSL.

**The generic projection Index.**

This index is created in advanced and will populate the ontology specific schema structure with the following
characteristics:

* Document will contain the query name and time of execution
* Document will contain all the nodes (vertices array) in the upper-most level of the document
* Document will contain all the relations (edges array ) in second level of the document - as a nested document under
  each relevant vertex

Each vertex/edge will contain the following fields:

* id
* type (label)
* properties (its own schematic fields)
* tag name (according to query)

In addition, each internal nested document (edge) will contain the additional fields:

* sideB.type
* sideB.id

This structure will simplify the creation of aggregations that will help further investigating the graph query results
with an efficient execution offloading to the OpenSearch engine.

It will also allow the storage of the results for future consumption and for the capability to consume the data in a
stream like manner using the page based query results consumption capability

### Example

The following Cypher Query results -

```text
   Match (p:Person {gender:FEMALE})-[o:Own]-(d:Dragon {color :BLACK}),
            (p:Person)-[oh:Own]-(h:Horse),
            (d:Dragon)-[f:Fire]-(other:Dragon { gender:MALE}),
            (h:Horse)-[org:OriginatedIn]->(k:Kingdom )
    RETURN *
```

Will be translated into the next document.

```json

{
  person: [
    {
      "type": Person,
      "id": p1
      "tag: p
      "properties": {}
      own: [
        {
          "id": 1
          "tag": o
          "type": Own
          sideB.type
          =
          "Dragon"
          sideB.id
          =
          d1
          "properties": {}
        },
        {
          "id": 2
          "tag": oh
          "type": Own
          sideB.type
          =
          "Horse"
          sideB.id
          =
          h1
          "properties": {}
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  dragon: [
    {
      "type": Dragon,
      "id": d1,
      "tag": d,
      fire: {
        "id": 1
        "tag": f
        sideB.type
        =
        "Dragon"
        sideB.id
        =
        d1
        "type": Fire,
        "properties": {}
      }
    },
    {
      "type": Dragon,
      "tag": other,
      "id": d1,
      "properties": {}
      ],
      horse: {
        originated: [
          {
          }
        ]
      }
      ],
      kingdom: [
        {
        }
      ]
    }
```

This document will be indexed in a dedicated 'query projection index' that can be later queried efficiently.
