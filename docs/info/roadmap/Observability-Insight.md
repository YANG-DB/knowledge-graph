# Observability Insight

This document will detail the data->knowledge-> insight journey trail in the observability domain.
We will review common problems that are inherently hard to solve, and we will present how the Knowledge plane components
help to simplify and generate tool box for solving these problems.

## A Typical Journey
The next parts depict a classic onboarding journey for an observability data consumer.

### Schema Defining 
This step will define the schema on which the observability knowledge is to be projected.
Since we are using Simple-Schema High level Observability Spec to define the knowledge domain - we will have to
map these logical structures to the physical indices according to some strategy that the customer has defined.
