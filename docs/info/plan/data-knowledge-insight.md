# Driving Knowledge from Data

### Introduction
This document will describe the recent years transition that data companies are going threw - the evolution
                                    
                  Data --> Knowledge --> Insight

Databases and data management technologies today are capable of handling the requirements of most organizations.

Data can power insights and applications but, that's not really possible without governance and metadata.

Today relevant question is not only about how to store lots of data, but rather, how to organize, keep track, and make sense of those ever-growing heaps of data.

This is where metadata and data catalogs come in metadata management market is expected to reach a massive $9.34 billion by 2023.

**According to Gartner**:

_"Metadata supports understanding of an organization's data assets, how those data assets are used, and their business value.
 Metadata management initiatives deliver business benefits such as improved compliance and corporate governance, better risk management,
 better shareability and reuse, and better assessments of the impact of change within an enterprise, while creating opportunities and guarding against threats."_

We see that as an affirmation of the fact that semantics-based knowledge graphs and metadata are a great match, and we expect to see more adoption of the approach in this space. 

A Knowledge Graph turns your data into machine-understandable knowledge, what separates data from knowledge? Knowing this answer is key to understanding the definition of knowledge graphs.

### What is Real-world knowledge ?

 - **Contextual**: meaning alters depending on circumstances

 - **Layered**: associations between concepts allow for nuanced understanding

 - **Evolving**: new discoveries instantly change meanings 


These facets of knowledge represent the context that is often missing from data. In traditional data management systems attempt to capture context, they often fail...

These failures generate gridlock over mastering data, delay timelines when adding new data sources or properties, and cause missing datasets from analyses that lead to mistrust.


**Knowledge Graphs,** on the other hand, are purpose-built for the fluctuating nature of data, by offering a more flexible foundation for evolution by easily accepting new **data**, new **definitions**, and new **requirements**.

Born from the semantic web, knowledge base instances ( such as the Google Knowledge Graph and the Wikipedia Knowledge Graph), have propelled their organizations to informational success.

Being data-driven is not enough — but knowledge-driven organizations can act with full context and full confidence in their decisions by generating insights from the knowledge.


### Managing Different Assets
Every company manages different types of assets - we can recongnize them as data collections.
Each one may be coupled into a specific domain or represent a certain business concern.

Asset types are defined in special knowledge graphs called Ontologies (aka models).
Ontologies that describe the pre-defined asset types may commonly be used for different known use cases and scenarios.

**Example:**
Information about assets is grouped into meaningful domains or collections – according to the asset type. 
For example, Glossary Terms are defined in Glossaries. Data sources such as Databases are cataloged in Data Asset Collections. 
ETL Scripts are typically cataloged in Technical Asset Collections. Glossary, Data Asset Collection and Technical Asset Collection are all types of knowledge graphs.
Different types of assets and different types of collections help focus and manage Data Governance Insight Recognition tasks .
