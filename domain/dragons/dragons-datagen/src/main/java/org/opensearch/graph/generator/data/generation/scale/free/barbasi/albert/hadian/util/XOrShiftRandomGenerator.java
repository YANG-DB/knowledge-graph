 * XOrShift is a very fast random number generator, used in ROLL-tree.
 * but not in SimpleRW and ROLL-bucket, since it might not have enough accuracy for them.
 * The reason is that ROLL-tree performs binary selections among two items with nearly equal probabilities,
 * but ROLL-bucket and SimpleRW need very accurate random numbers (selection among |E| items) this algorithm does not guarantee such accuracy.
